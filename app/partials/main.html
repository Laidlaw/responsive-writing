        <p class="lead">Writing is hard work. Every sentence is a decision to present an idea in a certain light.</p>
        <p class="lead">When we're having a conversation we can tailor our words, tone and gestures based on the context we are in but writing is meant to work with nearly no context.</p>
        <p class="lead">The World Wide Web was designed to move words around. Not pictures or sounds - words are the atomic unit of the web. Computer Science has a long history of attempting to link ideas together through the words that represent them.</p>
        <p class="lead">Since then, the internet has changed how we communicate with one another. We text and tweet but the way we organize our thoughts hasn't changed very much.</p>
        <p class="lead"><strong>Responsive Writing</strong> is both an experiment and a conversation. Its a new way to write and new way to connect ideas. Be a part of the conversation.</p>
